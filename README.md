# Full-Stack-App-With-BackEnd-FrontEnd
Node.js, Express, Typescript, Nodemon for Back-End, Next.js, React for Front-End

        This application is built using both back-end and front-end
        technologies. On the back-end side, we have utilized Node.js with
        TypeScript, Nodemon, and Express. As for the front-end, it is developed
        using Next.js and React. The purpose of this application is to create a
        back-end server that provides API information, which is then connected
        to the client-side.

To start the backend server, please use the command "npm start." For the frontend application, on the other hand, please run the command "npm run dev."
